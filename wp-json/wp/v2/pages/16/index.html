Mitchell<\/a>,\u00a0University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada<\/p>\n<h5>Abstract<\/h5>\n<p>Although reproducibility has been a fundamental tenet of science and engineering for hundreds of years, it has quietly but substantially deteriorated in the last few decades with the rise of first computational and now data driven research. This degradation has not been malicious (for the most part) but rather the gradual outcome of pressures and incentives rooted in academic tradition. Fortunately, the problem has been recognized and many efforts are underway to reverse the trend. In this talk I will outline some of those efforts and their successes. I will also discuss ongoing challenges, why we need to set reasonable expectations, and why we should continually revisit and raise them.<\/p>\n<h5><a href=\"https:\/\/cpsbench2018.ethz.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Ian.pdf\">Presentation slides<\/a><\/h5>\n<h5>Presenter Bio<\/h5>\n<p>Ian M. Mitchell completed his doctoral work in engineering at Stanford University in 2002, spent a year as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, and is now Professor and Associate Head (undergraduate) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. He is the author of the Toolbox of Level Set Methods, the first publicly available high accuracy implementation of solvers for dynamic implicit surfaces and the time dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equation that works in arbitrary dimension. His research interests include development of algorithms and software for nonlinear differential equations, formal verification, control and planning in cyber-physical and robotic systems, assistive technology and reproducible research.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/cpsbench2018.ethz.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/portrait_PeterTorelli.jpg\" alt=\"portrait_PeterTorelli\" width=\"873\" height=\"873\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Invited talk<\/h4>\n<p><em>IoTMark&#x2122;-BLE: How a Consortium Solved the IoT Benchmarking Problem<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Peter Torelli,\u00a0President of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eembc.org\/about\/consortiumleadership.php\">Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium (EEMBC)<\/a><\/p>\n<h5>Abstract<\/h5>\n<p>This presentation explains the process by which the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium (EEMBC) addressed the need for an IoT edge-node energy benchmark. During its multi-year development process, a diverse team of engineers had to comprehend IoT market demands to define a manageable solution space, and then select the wired and wireless protocols and define a balanced workload to represent that space in a single benchmark. This process was by no means trivial, and required a completely new testing methodology; the result is IoTMark-BLE, the first in a series of edge-node energy benchmarks offered by EEMBC.<\/p>\n<p>EEMBC, an industry alliance, develops benchmarks to help system designers select the optimal processors and understand the performance and energy characteristics of their systems.<\/p>\n<h5>Presenter Bio<\/h5>\n<p>Peter has a long history in the semiconductor industry, with 20 years at Intel as a software architect, hardware architect, and integration lead. His most significant contributions include driving power convergence for the Xeon Phi product line, and developing power-aware CAD tools and methodologies that have been used at Intel for over a decade. In early 2014, Peter left Intel and entered the Portland-area startup scene, working in diverse areas such as IoT wearables and fashion technology. After presenting at the IoT Developer Conference in 2015, Peter took the job as Director of Software Engineering at EEMBC, and became President\/CTO in 2017.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/cpsbench2018.ethz.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Belta.png\" alt=\"Calin Belta portrait picture\" width=\"287\" height=\"365\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Invited talk<\/h4>\n<p><em>Formal Synthesis of Control Strategies for Dynamical Systems<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/sites.bu.edu\/hyness\/calin\/\">Calin Belta<\/a>,\u00a0Boston University, USA<\/p>\n<h5>Abstract<\/h5>\n<p>In control theory, complex models of physical processes, such as systems of differential equations, are analyzed or controlled from simple specifications, such as stability and set invariance. In formal methods, rich specifications, such as formulae of temporal logics, are checked against simple models of software programs and digital circuits, such as finite transition systems. With the development and integration of cyber physical and safety critical systems, there is an increasing need for computational tools for verification and control of complex systems from rich, temporal logic specifications.<br \/>\nIn this talk, I will discuss a set of approaches to formal synthesis of control strategies for dynamical systems from temporal logic specifications. I will first show how automata games for finite systems can be extended to obtain conservative control strategies for low dimensional linear and multilinear dynamical systems. I will then present several methods to reduce conservativeness and improve the scalability of the control synthesis algorithms for more general classes of dynamics.<br \/>\nI will illustrate the usefulness of these approaches with examples from robotics and traffic control.<\/p>\n<h5><a href=\"https:\/\/cpsbench2018.ethz.ch\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Calin.pdf\">Presentation slides<\/a><\/h5>\n<h5>Presenter Bio<\/h5>\n<p>Calin Belta is a Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Boston University, where he holds the Tegan Family Distinguished Faculty Fellowship.
